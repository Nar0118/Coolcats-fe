<h1 id="cool-cats-charity">Cool Cats Charity</h1>
<p>A core value of the Cool Cats team is supporting others.</p>
<p>As NFTs continue to gain media attention, we see this as an opportunity to raise both awareness and capital in support of charitable causes.</p>
<p>We’re proud to have supported numerous organizations through unique programs such as our partnership with GHXST, where a one-of-one artwork co-created by Clon and GangYang raised more than $120,000 in donations. Assisted by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGivingBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Giving Block</a>, the proceeds raised were donated to Hope for Paws, Animal Equality, and the Rainforest Foundation. Our most recent NFT auction for this cute, cozy illustration by Clon raised 7E (about $28,000 at the time) for Blankets of Hope and was briefly mentioned in Forbes. We’re also proud to support wildlife conservation charity <a href="https://twitter.com/wildtomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Tomorrow</a>, and to help end childhood hunger with <a href="https://twitter.com/nokidhungry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Kid Hungry</a>.</p>
